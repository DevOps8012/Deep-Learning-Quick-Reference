# Practical Convolutional Neural Networks
This is the code repository for [Practical Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/practical-convolutional-neural-networks?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788392303), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is revolutionizing several application domains such as visual recognition systems, self-driving cars, medical discoveries, innovative eCommerce and more.You will learn to create innovative solutions around image and video analytics to solve complex machine learning and computer vision related problems and implement real-life CNN models.

This book starts with an overview of deep neural networkswith the example of image classification and walks you through building your first CNN for human face detector. We will learn to use concepts like transfer learning with CNN, and Auto-Encoders to build very powerful models, even when not much of supervised training data of labeled images is available.

Later we build upon the learning achieved to build advanced vision related algorithms for object detection, instance segmentation, generative adversarial networks, image captioning, attention mechanisms for vision, and recurrent models for vision.

By the end of this book, you should be ready to implement advanced, effective and efficient CNN models at your professional project or personal initiatives by working on complex image and video datasets.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 6)
```

Inform the reader of the things that they need to know before they start, and spell out what knowledge you are assuming.
Any additional installation instructions and information they need for getting set up.
